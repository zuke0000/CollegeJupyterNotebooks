    "### Periodic boundary conditions\n",
    "Ultimately, scientists would like to use molecular simulations to look at aggregate and macro-scale properties of collections of particles.  However, common objects (a coffee cup, for example) contain far more molecules than *any* computer could plausibly simulate at the level of detail that you've just implemented: the all pairs loop is simply too expensive.  Instead, we seek to perform simulations on small chunks of the material and hope that this is representative of the larger system.  For example, if we put 100 particles in a ten by ten box, we hope that the behavior there will be qualitatively similar to putting 10^12 particles in a 10^6 by 10^6 box.  However, this can only be true if we're careful about imposing boundaries.  If we don't, our small collection of particles will behave much differently than if they were sandwiched between many many other particles.  One way to simulate this latter effect is through the use of periodic boundary conditions.  This is a straightforward idea that is just a little bit tricky to implement.  The easy part is dealing with positions.  If we have a square periodic domain of size $L$, then anytime either position exceeds $L$, then we map it to $\\mathbf{x} - L$.  Alternatively one could just write\n",

    "As we saw with the game of life, animating the dynamics of a system can be very helpful in understanding what's going on.  **Modify the animation code from the game of life to animate your molecular dynamics simulation**.  The modifications should be relatively minimal.  In particular, instead of updating an \"imshow\" raster plot, you'll update a scatter plot.  I've provided a skeleton, but its specialized to my scheme for organizing degrees of freedom.  You'll need to modify it to yours.\n"
