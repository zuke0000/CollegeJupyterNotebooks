    "The purpose of this assignment is to provide a refresher on fundamental concepts that we will use throughout this course and provide an opportunity to develop skills in any of the related skills that may be unfamiliar to you. Through the course of completing this assignment, you will... \n",
    "- Refresh you knowledge of probability theory including properties of random variables, probability density functions,  cumulative distribution functions, and key statistics such as mean and variance.\n",
    "- Revisit common linear algebra and matrix operations and concepts such as matrix multiplication, inner and outer products, inverses, the Hadamard (element-wise) product, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, orthogonality, and symmetry.\n",
    "- Practice numerical programming, core to machine learning, by loading and filtering data, plotting data, vectorizing operations, profiling code speed, and debugging and optimizing performance. You will also practice computing probabilities based on simulation.\n",
    "- Develop or refresh your knowledge of Git version control, which will be a core tool used in the final project of this course\n",
    "- Apply your skills altogether through an exploratory data analysis to practice data cleaning, data manipulation, interpretation, and communication \n",

Also, the series of linear algebra videos by Grant Sanderson of 3Brown1Blue are excellent and can be viewed on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab).

    "3. Show that the eigenvectors are orthogonal to one another (e.g. their inner product is zero). This is true for eigenvectors from real, symmetric matrices. In three dimensions or less, this means that the eigenvectors are perpendicular to each other. Typically we use the orthogonal basis of our standard x, y, and z, Cartesian coordinates, which allows us, if we combine them linearly, to represent any point in a 3D space. But any three orthogonal vectors can do the same. We will see this property is used in PCA to identify the dimensions of greatest variation in our data when we discuss dimensionality reduction."

    "In data science, we often need to have a sense of the idiosyncrasies of the data, how they relate to the questions we are trying to answer, and to use that information to help us to determine what approach, such as machine learning, we may need to apply to achieve our goal. This exercise provides practice in exploring a dataset and answering question that might arise from applications related to the data.\n",

This dataset is the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) [Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID)](https://www.epa.gov/energy/emissions-generation-resource-integrated-database-egrid) containing information about all power plants in the United States, the amount of generation they produce, what fuel they use, the location of the plant, and many more quantities.

    "**[6 points]** *Vectorization*. When we first learn to code and think about iterating over an array, we often use loops. If implemented correctly, that does the trick. In machine learning, we iterate over so much data that those loops can lead to significant slow downs if they are not computationally efficient. In Python, vectorizing code and relying on matrix operations with efficient tools like numpy is typically the faster approach. Of course, numpy relies on loops to complete the computation, but this is at a lower level of programming (typically in C), and therefore is much more efficient. This exercise will explore the benefits of vectorization. Since many machine learning techniques rely on matrix operations, it's helpful to begin thinking about implementing algorithms using vector forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by creating an array of 10 million random numbers using the numpy `random.randn` module. Compute the sum of the squares of those random numbers first in a for loop, then using Numpy's `dot` module to perform an inner (dot) product. Time how long it takes to compute each and report the results and report the output. How many times faster is the vectorized code than the for loop approach? (Note - your results may vary from run to run).\n",

    "**[4 points]** Git is efficient for collaboration, and expectation in industry, and one of the best ways to share results in academia. You can even use some Git repositories (e.g. Github) as hosts for website, such as with the [course website](https://kylebradbury.github.io/ids705/index.html). As a data scientist with experience in machine learning, Git is expected. We will interact with Git repositories (a.k.a. repos) throughout this course, and your project will require the use of git repos for collaboration.\n",

    "## 12\n",
    "**[15 points]** Here you'll bring together some of the individual skills that you demonstrated above and create a Jupyter notebook based blog post on your exploratory data analysis. Your goal is to identify a question or problem and to work towards solving it or providing additional information or evidence (data) related to it through your data analysis. Below, we walk through a process to follow for your analysis. Additionally, you can find an [example of a well-done exploratory data analysis here from past years](https://github.com/kylebradbury/ids705/blob/master/assignments/Assignment_1_Q12_Example.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find a dataset that interests you and relates to a question or problem that you find intriguing.\n",
    "2. Describe the dataset, the source of the data, and the reason the dataset was of interest. Include a description of the features, data size, data creator and year of creation (if available), etc. What question are you hoping to answer through exploring the dataset?\n",
    "3. Check the data and see if they need to be cleaned: are there missing values? Are there clearly erroneous values? Do two tables need to be merged together? Clean the data so it can be visualized. If the data are clean, state how you know they are clean (what did you check?).\n",
    "3. Plot the data, demonstrating interesting features that you discover. Are there any relationships between variables that were surprising or patterns that emerged? Please exercise creativity and curiosity in your plots. You should have at least a ~3 plots exploring the data in different ways.\n",
    "4. What insights are you able to take away from exploring the data? Is there a reason why analyzing the dataset you chose is particularly interesting or important? Summarize this for a general audience (imagine your publishing a blog post online) - boil down your findings in a way that is accessible, but still accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here your analysis will evaluated based on:\n",
    "1. Motivation: was the purpose of the choice of data clearly articulated? Why was the dataset chosen and what was the goal of the analysis?\n",
    "2. Data cleaning: were any issues with the data investigated and, if found, were they resolved?\n",
    "3. Quality of data exploration: were at least 4 unique plots (minimum) included and did those plots demonstrate interesting aspects of the data? Was there a clear purpose and takeaway from EACH plot? \n",
    "4. Interpretation: Were the insights revealed through the analysis and their potential implications clearly explained? Was there an overall conclusion to the analysis?"

    "- Covid cases is a csv file recording covid cases and deaths for each day. Their source is based on reports from state and local health agencies. The data is several hundred entries as covid has started in late in 2020 and has been continuing up to now. Intuitively the features are date, cases for that day, and deaths for that day. Since I am inspecting dates in the year 2022, I will use pandas to filter the data to that year.\r\n",
    "- Google search trends is also a csv file recording the weekly 'popularity' of the search term \"covid symptoms\". The first column is the date and the second column is the 'popularity' for that week. It's worth noting that google doesn't provide specific numbers to the searches that were conducted. Rather they base it off of 'popularity' in which the week with the highest search terms has a value of 100.\r\n",
