We'll use the `sklearn` convention that a supervised learning algorithm has the methods `fit` which trains your algorithm (for KNN that means storing the data) and `predict` which identifies the K nearest neighbors and determines the most common class among those K neighbors. *Note: Most classification algorithms typically also have a method `predict_proba` which outputs the confidence score of each prediction, but we will explore that in a later assignment.*\n",

For each of these datasets there are $n=1000$ observations of each. They can be found in the `data` subfolder in the `assignments` folder on github.

Provide the estimated equation for this multiple regression model (e.g. if you chose your predictors to be $z_1 = x$ and $z_2 = log(x)$, your model would be of the form $y = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 log(x)$.
