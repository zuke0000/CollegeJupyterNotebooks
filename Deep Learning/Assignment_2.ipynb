    "**[18 points] Linear regression and nonlinear transformations**. Linear regression can be used to model nonlinear relationships when feature variables are properly transformed to represent the nonlinearities in the data. In this exercise, you're given training and test data contained in files \"A2_Q7_train.csv\" and \"A2_Q7_test.csv\" in the \"data\" folder for this assignment. Your goal is to develop a regression algorithm from the training data that performs well on the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint: Use the scikit learn [LinearRegression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html) module.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** Create a scatter plot of your training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** Estimate a linear regression model ($y = a_0 + a_1 x$) for the training data and calculate both the $R^2$ value and mean square error for the fit of that model for the training data. Also provide the equation representing the estimated model (e.g. $y = a_0 + a_1 x$, but with the estimated coefficients inserted. Consider this your baseline model against which you will compare other model options. *Evaluating performance on the training data is not a measure of how well this model would generalize to unseen data. We will evaluate performance on the test data once we see our models fit the training data decently well.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**(c)** If features can be nonlinearly transformed, a linear model may incorporate those non-linear feature transformation relationships in the training process. From looking at the scatter plot of the training data, choose a transformation of the predictor variable, $x$ that may make sense for these data. This will be a multiple regression model of the form $y = a_0 + a_1 z_1 + a_2 z_2 + \\ldots + a_n z_n$. Here $z_i$ could be any transformations of x - perhaps it's $\\frac{1}{x}$, $log(x)$, $sin(x)$, $x^k$ (where $k$ is any power of your choosing). Provide the estimated equation for this multiple regression model (e.g. if you chose your predictors to be $z_1 = x$ and $z_2 = log(x)$, your model would be of the form $y = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 log(x)$. Also provide the $R^2$ and mean square error of the fit for the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(d)** Visualize the model fit to the training data. Using both of the models you created in parts (b) and (c), plot the original data (as a scatter plot) AND the curves representing your models (each as a separate curve) from (b) and (c).\n",
    "\n",
    "**(e)** Now its time to compare your models and evaluate the generalization performance on held out test data. Using the models above from (b) an (c), apply them to the test data and estimate the $R^2$ and mean square error of the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(f)** Which models perform better on the training data, and which on the test data? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**(g)** Imagine that the test data were significantly different from the training dataset. How might this affect the predictive capability of your model? How would the accuracy of generalization performance be impacted? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "*To help get you started - here's some code to help you load in the data for this exercise (you'll just need to update the path)*:"
